= Roadmap

Our community strives to deliver major releases as per the designated schedules, while offering minor releases every other month! The roadmap outlines the vision, goals, and planned development milestones of our ongoing projects over a specific period of time. It also provides a high-level overview of the Inji stack's future direction, features, enhancements, and major updates.

Inji's principles, as discussed here, underpin the design and development of the roadmap. The year-wise roadmap details how these principles will be applied and advanced in a step-by-step manner, ensuring that the Inji stack evolves in alignment with the core principles.
