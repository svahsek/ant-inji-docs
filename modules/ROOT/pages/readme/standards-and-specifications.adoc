= Standards and Specifications

____
_Building on open standards isn’t just about technology—it’s about creating a seamless, secure, and globally trusted way for people to own, share, and verify their credentials effortlessly, no matter where they are._
____

Inji is built on open standards to ensure _interoperability, security, and trust_ in verifiable credentials. It adheres to globally recognized frameworks, making it _technically compliant with open standards_, allowing for _large-scale adoption across multiple countries_.

This document provides an overview of the _standards followed by Inji_ and how they guide the development of features for _credential issuance, storage, sharing, and verification_.

=== _1. Why Standards Matter?_

By adhering to open standards, Inji ensures that:

_ _Credentials are portable and verifiable* across different ecosystems.
_ _Trust frameworks are standardized*, enabling seamless interoperability.
_ _Security and privacy* are maintained through globally accepted cryptographic methods.&#x20;
_ It supports _adoption at scale*, allowing organizations, governments, and enterprises to integrate verifiable credentials efficiently.

=== _2. Open Standards Followed_

Inji follows globally recognized specifications to support _trusted digital verifiable credential solutions_:

==== _A. Verifiable Credentials & Data Models_

_W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.1 & 2.0_:

* Inji supports the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model for issuing, presenting, and verifying digital credentials.
* Follows the W3C VC format, enabling interoperability across different identity ecosystems.
* Supports JSON-LD and CBOR formats for VCs.

_ISO/IEC 18013-5_ – International standard for mobile driving licenses (mDL).

==== _B. Credential Issuance & Presentation_

_ _OpenID4VCI* – Standardized process for issuing verifiable credentials.
_ _OpenID4VP & OpenID4VP\_BLE_ – Enables verifiable presentations via OpenID protocols, including _offline sharing using BLE*.

==== _C. Secure Claims & Cryptographic Standards_

_ _Claim 169: IANA CBOR Web Token (CWT)* – Compact, privacy-preserving claims format for credentials.
_ _Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), RSA, and EdDSA_ – Ensures _strong cryptographic protection* for credential signing.

=== _3. Standards Followed in Inji_

_A. W3C Verifiable Credentials (VC)_

* Inji supports the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model for issuing, presenting, and verifying digital credentials.
* Follows the W3C VC format, enabling interoperability across different identity ecosystems.
* Supports JSON-LD, JWT, and CBOR formats for VCs.

_B. OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OpenID4VP)_

* Enables selective disclosure of credentials while maintaining user privacy.
* Supports QR code-based and deep-linking mechanisms for credential presentation.
* Ensures verifier authentication to prevent unauthorized access.

_C. OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OpenID4VCI)_

* Facilitates the secure issuance of VCs to holders.
* Supports various credential formats, including SD-JWT and mDoc/mDL.
* Implements OAuth 2.0-based authorization for credential issuance.

_D. ISO/IEC 18013-5 (Mobile Driving Licenses - mDL)_

* Enables interoperability with government-issued mobile driver’s licenses (mDL).
* Supports NFC and QR-based interactions for secure credential exchange.

_E. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) & DIDComm_

* Uses W3C DID standards for self-sovereign identity.
* Implements DIDComm for secure peer-to-peer communication between holders, verifiers, and issuers.
