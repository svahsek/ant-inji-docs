Inji  is a verifiable credentialing stack that provides a way to share tamper-proof, instantly verifiable data which is cryptographically signed by a trusted issuer, and users can store them securely on their devices or browsers and share them when needed.

_ _Issuer*: The entity that issues the credential and makes claims about the subject (e.g., a university issuing a degree, a government issuing a passport, an employer issuing a work permit). The issuer cryptographically signs the VC. Inji's 'Issuance-module' is called [Inji Certify](./inji-certify/overview/README.adoc).
_ _Holder*: The individual or entity which possesses the credential (e.g., the student with the degree, the citizen with the passport, the employee with the work permit). The holder stores and manages their VCs. Inji's 'Holder-module' is called [Inji Wallet](./inji-wallet/inji-mobile/README.adoc).
_ _Verifier*: The entity that requests and verifies the credential to confirm a claim (e.g., an employer checking a degree, a border agent checking a passport, a landlord checking a work permit). The verifier checks the cryptographic proofs to ensure the VC's authenticity and integrity. [Inji Verify](./inji-verify/overview/README.adoc).

Some everyday examples of 'Verifiable Credentials' include:
* A national ID issued as a digital credential
* A diploma issued by a university
* A background verification report from an employer
* A subsidy or benefit eligibility certificate from a government agency

VCs allow:
* Instant verification, even offline
* User control over when and how data is shared
* Interoperability across platforms and borders
* Reduced fraud and manual checks

= Component Diagram
This section will contain a clear diagram illustrating the interaction between Inji Certify, Inji Wallet (mobile + web), Inji Verify. The diagram should also show the components involved to build Inji.

== How it works?
_ _Issuance*: An issuer creates a digital credential with claims about a subject and cryptographically signs it.
_ _Holding*: The signed credential is then given to the holder, who stores it securely in a digital wallet or similar application.
_ _Presentation*: When needed, the holder can present the VC (or a verifiable presentation, which can include multiple VCs or selectively disclosed information) to a verifier.
_ _Verification*: The verifier uses the cryptographic proofs within the VC to confirm that it was issued by a trusted party and has not been tampered with. This verification often involves checking against a "Verifiable Data Registry" where public keys of issuers are stored.
