The workshop aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Inji ecosystem, focusing on its various components, configuration, and practical usage. It covered essential topics to help participants effectively use and integrate Inji's features.

_ _Understanding DID Methods*: The workshop explains the different Decentralized Identifier (DID) methods supported by Inji, helping participants grasp how digital identities are managed.
_ _OIDC Client and p12 File Creation*: Participants learn how to create an OIDC client and generate a p12 file, ensuring secure key storage and authentication processes.
_ _Configuring Mimoto in Inji Web*: Detailed steps are provided to configure Mimoto within the Inji Web application, addressing common issues and ensuring seamless integration.
_ _Credential Management_: The workshop covers how credentials are stored, secured, and validated in both _Web_ and _Wallets*, emphasizing security and compliance with standards.
_ _Real-World Deployment and Integration*: It discusses the roles of issuers and service providers in real-world deployments, the use of blockchain for security, and the potential for running AI agents for selective disclosure.

The Workshop demonstrates how to integrate Inji Certify, a credential issuance platform, with a custom data provider plugin to issue 'Verifiable Credentials'. The specific use case covered is issuing farmer IDs based on official land registry data.

_ _Data Setup*: A sample farmer registry is created in a database with details like National ID, Name, Phone Number, and Land Ownership Information.
_ _Configuration*: A velocity template is defined to format the data, issuer information and verification keys are configured, and a "well-known" property is set up.
_ _Plugin Development*: A data provider plugin is created to fetch farmer data from the registry based on the national ID.
_ _Docker Compose Setup*: A Docker environment is set up to run the database, Inji Certify, Nginx, and Inji Web.
_ _Demonstration*: A farmer ID is entered, authenticated, and a verifiable credential is issued based on the retrieved data.

The webinar delves into the technical architecture and implementation details of the Inji Stack, specifically focusing on the Inji Wallet and its integration with other stacks/components like eSignet and Inji Certify. The webinar offers a comprehensive overview of the technical intricacies involved in building a decentralized credential issuance and verification system using the MOSIP's Inji platform.

_ _Inji Wallet:* A mobile application that acts as both a digital wallet for storing verifiable credentials (VCs) and a verifier of VCs.
_ _Integration with eSignet and Inji Certify:* eSignat is used for authentication and authorization, while Inji Certify is responsible for issuing VCs.
_ _Technical Architecture:* The webinar covers the high-level architecture, including the use of Mimoto as a backend for frontend (BFF), the role of the Tuvali library for secure VC transfer, and the integration of native modules for specific functionalities.
_ _API Interactions:* The session explains how Inji Wallet interacts with various APIs, including those for fetching issuer lists, obtaining access tokens, and binding wallets to relying parties.
_ _Configuration:* The webinar discusses the configuration aspects, such as setting up issuer information, defining VC templates, and configuring the connection to eSignet.
_ _Development and Integration:* The presentation provides insights into the development process, including the use of React Native for the mobile app, the integration of native modules, and the management of data storage.
