### Audit Logging for Certificates, API Key, SBI Expiry Notifications

To enhance traceability, PMS now captures audit logs for all certificate expiry-related notifications, including those shown on the portal and sent via email. Notifications for Root CA, Intermediate CA, Partner, FTM Chip Certificates & API Keys, SBIs—as well as the Weekly Summary of partner certificates, FTM Chip Certificates, SBIs, API Keys sent to Partner Admins—are tracked for both success and failure events. Each event is recorded in the audit.app_audit_log table with a unique event ID and reference details. The logs include metadata such as module name, notification ID, and type. The feature ensures greater transparency and accountability in certificate lifecycle communication.

In case of weekly summary notifications, audit logs are generated regardless of whether any partner-specific items—such as FTM Chip Certificates, SBI, Partner Certificates, or API Keys—are expiring (or not) in a given week. This includes logging events where no expiry notifications are triggered, ensuring consistent traceability for all weekly notification cycles, even if the system determines that there are no expiring items for the period.
