   - Integrates with CI/CD for continuous, up-to-date docs
   - Delivers a unified, branded, and searchable portal
2. **Aligns Documentation with Modern DevOps**
   - “Docs as code” in Git: versioned, reviewable, and collaborative
   - Encourages developer and writer contributions
   - Automates publishing and validation in CI/CD pipelines
3. **Modular, Scalable, and Future-Proof**
   - Each component/team owns its docs, but output is unified
   - Supports any number of components, versions, and teams
   - Easily adapts to new microservices or product lines

## 2. CBA/Microservices Documentation Pain Points
- Distributed content (many repos, many teams)
- Versioning complexity (multiple active versions)
- Duplication/inconsistency (manual copy-paste)
- Fragile cross-links (broken navigation)
- Siloed workflows (docs not in dev process)
- Poor user experience (fragmented, hard to search)

## 3. Antora’s Strategic Solutions
1. **Content Aggregation**
   - Pulls docs from multiple Git repos/components
   - Logical structure decoupled from physical storage
2. **Advanced Versioning**
   - Maps docs to Git branches/tags
   - Auto-generates version selectors for users
3. **Content Reuse**
   - AsciiDoc partials, examples, attributes
   - Single-source-of-truth for shared content
4. **URL-Agnostic Cross-Referencing**
   - Logical xref macros prevent broken links
5. **Unified Publishing**
   - Consistent UI, navigation, and search
   - Static site output for easy hosting
